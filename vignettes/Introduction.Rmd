The package `ammistability` is .........














## Installation
The package can be installed using the following functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages('ammistability', dependencies=TRUE)

# Install development version from Github
devtools::install_github("ajaygpb/ammistability")

```

Then the package can be loaded using the function
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ammistability) # change eval
```


## AMMI

The AMMI equation

$$Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_{i} + \beta_{j} + \sum_{n=1}^{N}\lambda_{n}\gamma_{in}\delta_{jn} + \rho_{ij}$$

Where, $Y_{ij}$ is the yield of the $i$th genotype in the $j$th environment, $\mu$ is the grand mean, $\alpha_{i}$ is the genotype deviation from the grand mean, $\beta_{j}$ is the environment deviation, $N$ is the total number of interaction principal components (IPCs), $\lambda_{n}$ is the is the singular value for $n$th IPC and correspondingly $\lambda_{n}^{2}$  is its eigen value, $\gamma_{in}$ is the eigenvector value for $i$th genotype, $\delta_{jn}$  is the eigenvector value for the $j$th environment and $\rho_{ij}$ is the residual.



## AMMI stability parameters

The details about AMMI stability parameters/indices implemented in `ammistability` are described in Table 1.

# stabparams$Details <- gsub("$$\\, $$$$", "$$", stabparams$Details, fixed = TRUE)

stabparams$Reference <- gsub("\\[|\\]", "", stabparams$Reference)
stabparams <- stabparams[-c(1),]

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}

               justify = c('left'), split.table = Inf, keep.line.breaks = TRUE,
               use.hyphening = FALSE, missing = "")
```

Where,
  $N$ is the total number of interaction principal components (IPCs);
  $N'$ is the number of significant IPCAs (number of IPC that were retained in the AMMI model via F tests);
  $\lambda_{n}$ is the is the singular value for $n$th IPC and correspondingly $\lambda_{n}^{2}$  is its eigen value;
  $\gamma_{in}$ is the eigenvector value for $i$th genotype;
  $\delta_{jn}$  is the eigenvector value for the $j$th environment;
  $SSIPC_{1}$, $SSIPC_{2}$, $\cdots$, $SSIPC_{n}$ are the sum of squares of the 1st, 2th, ..., and $n$th IPC;
  $PC_{1}$, $PC_{2}$, $\cdots$, $PC_{n}$ are the scores of 1st, 2th, ..., and $n$th IPC;
  $\theta_{n}$ is the percentage sum of squares explained by $n$th principal component interaction effect; and
  $E$ is the number of environments.

## Simultaneous selection indices for yield and stability

The most stable genotype need not necessarily be the highest yielding genotype. Hence, simultaneous selection indices (SSIs) have been proposed for the selection of stable as well as high yielding genotypes.

A family of simultaneous selection indices ($I_{i}$) were proposed by @rao_use_2005 similar to those proposed by @bajpai_new_2000 by incorporating the AMMI Based Stability Parameter ($ASTAB$) and Yield as components. These indices consist of yield component, measured as the ratio of the average performance of the $i$th genotype to the overall mean performance of the genotypes under test and a stability component, measured as the ratio of stability information ($\frac{1}{ASTAB}$) of the $i$th genotype to the mean stability information of the genotypes under test.

$$I_{i} = \frac{\overline{Y}_{i}}{\overline{Y}_{..}} + \alpha \frac{\frac{1}{ASTAB_{i}}}{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}\frac{1}{ASTAB_{i}}}$$

Where $ASTAB_{i}$ is the stability measure of the $i$th genotype under AMMI procedure;  $Y_{i}$ is mean performance of $i$th genotype; $Y_{..}$ is the overall mean; $T$ is the number of genotypes under test and $\alpha$ is the ratio of the weights given to the stability components ($w_{2}$) and yield ($w_{1}$) with a restriction that $w_{1} + w_{2} = 1$. The weights can be specified as required (Table 2).

**Table 2 :** $\alpha$ and corresponding weights ($w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$)
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
w1 = c(0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8)
w2 = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2)
a = round(w2/w1, 2)

alph <- data.frame(alpha = a, w1, w2)

knitr::kable(alph, row.names = FALSE, col.names = c("$\\alpha$", "$w_{1}$", "$w_{2}$"))

``` 

In `ammistability`, the above expression has been implemented for all the stability parameters ($SP$) including ASTAB.

$$I_{i} = \frac{\overline{Y}_{i}}{\overline{Y}_{..}} + \alpha \frac{\frac{1}{SP_{i}}}{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}\frac{1}{SP_{i}}}$$

Genotype stability index ($GSI$) [@farshadfar_incorporation_2008] or Yield stability index ($YSI$) [@farshadfar_ammi_2011; @jambhulkar_stability_2017] is a simultaneous selection index for yield and yield stability which is computed by summation of the ranks of the stability index/parameter and the ranks of the mean yields. $YSI$ is computed for all the stability parameters/indices implemented in this package.

$$GSI = YSI = R_{SP} + R_{Y}$$

Where, $R_{SP}$ is the stability parameter/index rank of the genotype and $R_{Y}$ is the mean yield rank of the genotype.

The function `SSI` implements both these indices in `ammistability`. Further, for each of the stability parameter functions, the simultaneous selection index is also computed by either of these functions as specifiend by the argument `ssi.method`. 

## Examples

## Citing `ammistability`

```{r, echo = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
detach("package:ammistability", unload=TRUE)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ammistability))
cit <- citation("ammistability")
# yr <- format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")
# cit[1]$year <- yr
# oc <- class(cit)
# 
# cit <- unclass(cit)
# attr(cit[[1]],"textVersion") <- gsub("\\(\\)",
#                                      paste("\\(", yr, "\\)", sep = ""),
#                                      attr(cit[[1]],"textVersion"))
# class(cit) <- oc
