	abstract = {Thirteen winter and intermediate type bread wheat cultivars were evaluated for yield stability under dryland conditions over a four year period from 1991 to 1994 and over a total of 120 environments in the Western, Central and Eastern Free State wheat producing regions of South Africa. The following statistical analyses were conducted and procedures followed to determine yield stability: (i) Shukla's procedure of stability variance(*2j); (ii) Lin and Binns cultivar performance measure (Pi); (iii) Finlay and Wilkenson's regression analysis and coefficient (b); (iv) Eberhart and Russel's deviation from regression (S2d); (v) Wricke's ecovalence (W1); (vi) AMMI model. Since the AMMI model does not make provision for a quantitative stability measure, such a measure was developed to rank genotypes. Total correspondence for significance of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for the different analysis procedures was noted over the three production regions. No significant rank correlation coefficients were found in the pairwise comparisons of both Lin and Binns' and Finlay and Wilkenson's procedures with the other procedures, nor in the comparison between the two mentioned procedures. This indicates that the Lin and Binns procedure, as well as the Finlay and Wilkenson procedure, differ significantly from the other procedures in stability determination and definition, and due to noted deficiencies are consequently not recommended for use. From the study it would appear that if a single method of describing the stability of a genotype had to be selected, the proposed AMMI Stability Value (ASV) AMMI model would be the most appropriate. Certain cultivars showed similar stability over the three regions, while others varied considerably over the three regions.},

	abstract = {Joint regression and Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) models were compared for i) capacity of describing genotype-location (GL) and genotype-environment (GE) interaction effects (environments = location-season combinations), assessed in terms of estimated variance of heterogeneity of genotype regressions and of the sum of the variances of significant interaction principal component (PC) axes, and ii) repeatability between cropping seasons of measures of genotype stability across locations. These measures were Finlay and Wilkinson's regression coefficient for joint regression, and the Euclidean distance from the origin of significant interaction PC axes (D) and the absolute value of PC 1 score ({\textbar} PC 1 {\textbar}) for AMMI. Shukla's stability variance (ssup2;) was considered in addition. The study included three data sets for durum wheat, two for maize and one each for bread wheat and oat. Relationships between climatic variables and GL interaction occurrence were also assessed. AMMI proved distinctly more valuable in six data sets for description of GE effects and in four for description of GL effects over seasons. Its superiority was not crop-specific and tended to occur when more, distinct environmental constraints affected genotype responses. When both methods were appropriate, they provided a similar ordination of sites and genotypes for GL effects. The models that adequately described GL interaction over seasons generally provided also stability measures that were moderately repeatable between seasons. D was better repeatable than {\textbar} PC 1 {\textbar} and s\& 2; in a few cases. Ordination of locations on GL interaction PC 1 tended to be consistent both between wheat and between maize data sets having either no seasons or no genotypes in common.},
